# Restaurant_Segmentation

Developed by Pirate-Emperor, Restaurant_Segmentation is a machine learning project that focuses on segmenting restaurants based on their characteristics using a dataset from Zomato. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses the Zomato dataset to prepare it for machine learning models.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performs a comprehensive analysis of the dataset to understand the underlying patterns and distributions.
- **Feature Engineering**: Enhances the dataset by creating new features and transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
- **Clustering Algorithm**: Implements clustering algorithms (such as K-Means) to segment restaurants based on similarities.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the performance of the clustering model using appropriate metrics.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualizations to represent the clusters and their characteristics.

## Prerequisites

To run the project, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (e.g., numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pirate-Emperor/Restaurant_Segmentation.git
cd Restaurant_Segmentation
```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the `Restaurant_Segmentation.ipynb` file and open it.

Execute the cells in the notebook to preprocess the data, implement the clustering algorithm, evaluate the model, and display visualizations.

## Data Source

The project uses a dataset from Zomato, which includes information about restaurants such as location, price range, ratings, cuisines, etc. You can replace the dataset with an updated version from Zomato or any other similar platform.

## Development

To enhance the project, you can modify the Jupyter Notebook (`Restaurant_Segmentation.ipynb`). Some potential areas for improvement include:

- Experimenting with different clustering algorithms and parameters for better segmentation.
- Incorporating additional features, such as customer reviews or restaurant amenities.
- Implementing a recommendation system based on the segmentation results.
- Deploying the model as a web service for real-time analysis.
